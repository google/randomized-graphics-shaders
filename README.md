Graphics shader corpora
=======================

This repo hosts a collection of graphics shaders, mainly generated by randomized
program generators such as [GraphicsFuzz](https://github.com/google/graphicsfuzz), [spirv-fuzz](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools#fuzzer) and [WGSLsmith](https://github.com/hasali19/WGSLsmith). The shaders
are intended for use by mutation-based fuzzers, such as libFuzzer.

The purpose of making available specific outputs of tools that can randomly
generate endless examples is that it is convenient to be able to pull a
moderate-sized set of generated examples into a fuzzing project, rather than
going to the effort of hooking the generation tools up to the fuzzing project.
